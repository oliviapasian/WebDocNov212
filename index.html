                    <p>No, cookies are not necessarily "bad". Cookies are small strings of data that are stored directly in the browser. They are used to monitor your browsing activity and remember certain information about you — like what’s in your shopping cart, or your login information. Often, they are considered helpful and a necessary part to run many websites. </p>

                    <p>A few years ago, the GDPR privacy law went into effect in Europe, which led to companies all over the world adding a cookie pop-up to their website, just to be on the safe side. That's why almost every website has a pop-up asking if you'll accept their use of cookies, which many of us approve without thinking.</p>

                    <p>Part of the fear and concern surrounding cookies and browsing privacy is that they are not widely understood. It sounds scary to think of websites storing little pieces of our data, but upon entering most websites, we are prompted with an annoying little pop-up asking the question:</p>
                    <h4>"CAN WE USE COOKIES? READ OUR PRIVACY POLICY!"</h4>

               <p>These often block our view of the rest of the page and we see them so often that many of us will just click "accept" to be done with it. Do we ever actually read those privacy policies, though?</p>
                <p>As shown previously, you can specifically check on cookies in your browser, but privacy policies are the best way to get a sense of what a website may be doing with your data and information. </p>
                <p>Take <a href="policy.html" target="_blank">this website's privacy policy</a> as an example. You had probably just clicked accept without reading it, right?</p>

The results were that nearly <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/how-americans-view-data-privacy/" target="_blank">6 in 10</a> Americans frequently skip reading privacy policies.                    </p>

                    <p>Not reading privacy policies is something we all do and often doesn't visibly affect our daily browsing activities. But by consenting to something without knowing what it is opens up the opportunity for a website to do whatever it wants.</p>

On the other hand, requiring them to simply click a big, bright "ACCEPT" without providing clear understanding of what they’re agreeing to doesn’t seem like an effective solution.

                <p>Privacy-centered regulations, such as the GDPR, are increasing alongside our awareness of data privacy issues.
